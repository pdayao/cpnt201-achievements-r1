  <p>  Roger Turner - Poet Mar 2014
It's always Friday Night
Once the work days over
It's always Friday Night
It doesn't matter what the day is
Friday Night can be tonight
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Because tomorrow never comes
Tonight is Friday Night for sure
So get out and have some fun

Get your boots on and get ready
Party starts with the first beer
Music's playing on the jukebox
Right now, it's just me here
Doesn't matter, it's still Friday
And it's Friday right till close
Shake it out, let's get it started
It's Friday, let's see how this thing goes

Every day that ends in y
Has a sun up in the sky
From now until I die
Will be Friday Night to me
Yep...it's Friday Night to me

Now the party's getting started
Jukebox off and the band is on
It's Friday night regardless
We're here till the beer is gone
don't worry about tomorrow
Because tomorrow never comes
Now, the band is really flying
Get on up and shake yer buns

It really doesn't matter
If you take the time to think
It's always Friday with the music
It's always Friday with the drink
Got our friends around us
We'll party through the night
Friends, and drinks and music
We are gonna do it right

Don't worry about tomorrow
Because Tomorrow never comes
It's always Friday Night around here
Join in and have some fun
